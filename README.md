**What is accelerometer?**

An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration. Proper acceleration, being the acceleration (or rate of change of velocity) of a body in its own instantaneous rest frame, is not the same as coordinate acceleration, being the acceleration in a fixed coordinate system. For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration due to Earth's gravity, straight upwards (by definition) of g â‰ˆ 9.81 m/s2. By contrast, accelerometers in free fall (falling toward the center of the Earth at a rate of about 9.81 m/s2) will measure zero. [More...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer)

**What is my goal?**

I want to collect accelerometer data from my smart phone. And after that i want ot create model, which will predict class of my activity (for example: running or walking).

**How will I do it?**

I will collect data with [AndroSensor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fivasim.androsensor). And I will use this data for modeling.

**Note:**

This repository contains all of my work (*code, description, jupyter notebooks, papers, data*).
